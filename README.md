Automated-CI-CD-Pipeline-with-Docker
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an Automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker to build, test, and deploy applications automatically.
It ensures faster release cycles, zero manual deployment errors, and consistent environments across development and production.

🛠 Tech Stack
GitHub Actions – Pipeline automation
Docker – Containerization
Docker Hub – Image registry
Python/Node.js – Sample application
Bash – Deployment automation
Linux/Ubuntu – Deployment environment

⚙️ How It Works
Push code → Developer commits changes to GitHub
CI/CD Trigger → GitHub Actions starts pipeline
Build → Docker builds application image
Test → Runs tests inside the container
Push → Pushes image to Docker Hub
Deploy → Server pulls and runs the latest image
docker build -t myapp:latest . docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp:latest
